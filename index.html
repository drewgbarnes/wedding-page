                            <p>In May 2014, Tori started working at OSU. After finally having some free time she was thirsty. After using Tommy as eye candy for several months she decied to make a move and marry him. For a period of a few weeks the two began echanging drunken snap chats, while still enjoying their weekly Friday shift together. They met once before their first date. Tori convince a drunk time for bed Tommy to go back out and meet her at the biggest wreck of a bar on campus, Big Bar. They night was cut short when the bouncer reapplied her X's on her hands. The next week was spent strategicly planning with her friends until she scored a first date. On Friday Februray 6th, 2014, Tommys life was over. He was so scared he didn't even know what he was doing, continuously calling his team, the Blue Jackets, the Clippers. They pulled out an astounding 7-1 victory. After quite litterally falling for the charming qualities of her ruse, she spent a lovely late evening with him in the ER. Her arm was toast. She was invited to the single man's dream vacation a road trip across the country. There they bonded until completely established as a couple. Shortly after Tommy graduated and move on to a full time job, and Tori just could not help herself to his salary. Now after months of being brain-washed, they are getting married.</p>
